# My Portfolio

My first app made in Svelte, while on a Tablet and Termux, because NextJS couldn't run lol

## Features:
  * Blog
    * GitHub-like alerts (warning, caution...)
    * Full markdown support 
    * Partial HTML support (mainly for images)
    * XML Feed
  * Bento-grid design (main page)
    * OpenWeather card

## Running

```
npm run dev
```
